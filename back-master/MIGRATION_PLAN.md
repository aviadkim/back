# Vertical Slice Architecture Migration Plan

## Progress
- ‚úÖ Created project structure with vertical slices
- ‚úÖ Migrated PDF processing feature
- ‚úÖ Migrated document upload feature
- ‚úÖ Migrated financial analysis feature 
- ‚úÖ Migrated document QA feature

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create adapters for original files
2. Migrate remaining features:
   - Authentication
   - Export functionality
   - Advanced analytics
3. Update imports across the codebase
4. Implement proper dependency injection

### Technical Debt to Address
1. Consolidate utility code in `shared/` directory
2. Add comprehensive tests for each feature
3. Create proper API documentation with OpenAPI
4. Update CI/CD pipeline for new structure
5. Implement feature toggles for gradual rollout

| Advanced Analytics   | ‚è≥ Pending   | features/portfolio_analysis            | Waiting for financial migration|
| Shared Utilities     | üîÑ In Progress | shared/                             | Currently consolidating        |

## Architecture Decision Records
1. Feature folders contain all aspects of a feature: API, service, models, tests
2. Shared code only when truly used across multiple features
3. Adapters used for backward compatibility during migration
4. Clear interfaces between features via well-defined service classes
