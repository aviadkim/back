# Financial Document Processor - Vertical Slice Architecture

This is the reorganized version of the Financial Document Processor using vertical slice architecture.

## Features

The system is organized by business features rather than technical concerns:

- **Document Upload**: Upload and manage financial documents
- **PDF Processing**: Extract text and data from PDF documents
- **Financial Analysis**: Extract and analyze financial data from documents
- **Document Q&A**: Ask questions about document content
- **Document Export**: Export document data in various formats

## Running the Application

```bash
# Start the application
./start_full_app.sh
```

## Architecture Overview
