# Release Notes - Version 5.0.0

## Financial Document Analysis System - Vertical Slice Architecture

**Release Date: March 31, 2025**

We are excited to announce the release of version 5.0.0 of the Financial Document Analysis System. This major release introduces a complete implementation of Vertical Slice Architecture, providing better code organization, feature isolation, and maintainability.

## Major Highlights

- **Independent Deployment**: Features can be deployed separately
- **Enhanced Document Processing**: Improved document analysis capabilities

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for usage and further development

## New Features

### PDF Scanning Feature

- Identify financial entities automatically
- Save processed documents for further analysis

### Document Chat

### Table Extraction

## Technical Improvements

- **Reorganized Structure**: Code is now organized by feature rather than technical layer
- **Feature-Specific Components**: Each feature has its own routes, services, and UI components
- **Reduced Coupling**: Features are isolated, reducing dependencies between different parts of the application
- **Testing Improvements**: Comprehensive test suite for each feature
