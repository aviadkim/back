## Latest Updates (April 2, 2025)

### Enhanced Financial Data Extraction
We've implemented a more comprehensive financial data extraction system that:

1. Extracts ISINs more reliably with improved pattern matching
2. Identifies associated data around each ISIN including potential security names
3. Detects currency amounts, percentages, and numeric values
4. Attempts to reconstruct tables from text-based data

### New API Endpoints
- Added `/api/documents/<id>/enhanced` endpoint that provides rich financial data extraction
- Fixed the tables endpoint to properly handle documents without tables

### Test Improvements
- All unit tests for ISIN extraction now pass
- API tests verify that all endpoints return proper responses
- Integration tests for document processing work with sample PDFs

### Next Steps for SaaS Conversion

1. **Database Integration (Next Priority)**
   - Set up MongoDB connection in app.py
   - Create schemas for documents and users
   - Implement data migration from file storage

2. **User Authentication**
   - Add user registration and login endpoints
   - Implement JWT-based authentication
   - Create access control for document access

3. **Frontend Enhancements**
   - Fix JSON parsing issues 
   - Add financial data visualizations
   - Create user dashboard

4. **Deployment Infrastructure**
   - Update Dockerfile for production
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline

The enhanced financial data extraction capability dramatically improves our value proposition by providing deeper financial insights from documents. This is a crucial step in making our SaaS offering more competitive in the market.
