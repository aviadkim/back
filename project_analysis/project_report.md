### Low Priority
- **Consider using more configuration files to manage environment settings**
  - *Why*: Multi-language projects benefit from clear configuration management
- **Consider organizing code into a src/ directory and separating from configuration files**
  - *Why*: Improved organization helps maintainability as projects grow
