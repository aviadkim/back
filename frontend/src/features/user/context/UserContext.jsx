UserContext Component Guide:

This context provides user authentication and profile data to the entire application.
It handles:

1. User authentication state (logged in/out)
2. User profile information
3. Authentication operations (login, logout, register)
4. Loading user data from local storage or token
5. Managing user preferences

The context uses React's Context API to make user data and authentication
functions available throughout the application without prop drilling.

How to use:
- Wrap your application with the UserContextProvider
- Access user data and functions using the useUser hook
- Check authentication status with isAuthenticated
- Access current user data with userData
