# Financial Document Analysis System - Technical Documentation

## System Architecture

This application is a Flask-based web service that processes financial documents, extracts information, and provides analysis. It has the following major components:

1. **Web API Layer**: Flask application with RESTful endpoints
2. **Document Processing**: OCR and text extraction from PDF files
3. **Financial Analysis**: Extraction of financial data (ISINs, etc.)
4. **Table Processing**: Detection and extraction of tables from documents
5. **Question Answering**: AI-based Q&A about document contents
6. **Frontend**: Web UI for interaction with the system

## Key API Endpoints

* `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
* `POST /api/documents/upload` - Upload and process a document
* `GET /api/documents` - List all documents
* `GET /api/documents/<id>` - Get document details
* `GET /api/documents/<id>/content` - Get document content
* `GET /api/documents/<id>/financial` - Get financial data
* `GET /api/documents/<id>/tables` - Get extracted tables
* `GET /api/documents/<id>/advanced_analysis` - Get advanced analysis
* `POST /api/qa/ask` - Ask a question about a document

## Data Flow

1. User uploads document via the frontend or API
2. Document is stored and OCR processing extracts text
3. Financial data extraction identifies ISINs and related information
4. Tables are detected and processed
5. User can query data through various endpoints or Q&A

## Deployment

The application is currently configured to run on port 5001 in development mode. For SaaS deployment, several changes will be needed:

1. **Containerization**: Package the application using Docker
2. **Cloud Hosting**: Deploy to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure)
3. **Database**: Replace file-based storage with proper database
4. **Authentication**: Add user authentication and API keys
5. **Monitoring**: Add logging and monitoring
6. **Scaling**: Configure auto-scaling for production loads

## SaaS Considerations

To turn this into a SaaS product:

1. **Multi-tenancy**: Add organization/user isolation
2. **Billing**: Integrate payment processing
3. **Usage Limits**: Implement API rate limiting
4. **User Management**: Add user roles and permissions
5. **Dashboard**: Create admin dashboard for monitoring
6. **Documentation**: Create user documentation

## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: Python, Flask
* **OCR**: Tesseract (supporting Hebrew + English)
* **AI**: Various NLP and machine learning components
* **Storage**: Currently file-based, should move to database
* **Frontend**: HTML, JavaScript (could be enhanced with React)
